# SKYNET - A Weather App

## Overview

This app was created as a personal portfolio project. It pulls data [WeatherAPI](http://api.weatherapi.com/v1) to display the **current weather condition for the searched location** as well as the **forecast weather for the next 3 days**.

## Features

The app makes use of

- WeatherAPI for requesting weather-data
- Axios for data-fetching
- Debounce for limiting API calls
- MUI library for styling and theming
- MUI sx prop for custom styling of components
- React-Full-Screen to enable the FullScreen Feature for desktop screens
- Breakpoints & FlexBox for Responsive Styles

## TODO List

Planning to add some more features

- Default searching of user's location using `navigator API`
- Creation of an About Page
- Creation of a Footer with Social Links at the main page
- Create a link to all the dependency packages' website
- Add a strip at top to show loading, error etc. state
- Create a "fetch-Mock-Data" Option for user in case the network is down or for debug purposes
